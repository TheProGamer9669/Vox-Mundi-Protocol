# Vox-Mundi
A protocol for unrestricted node communication

this protocol was first thought of by my father, now I have the tools & knowlege to make it come to life :)
It is a basic protocol for data/message transfer using my custom encoding so not just anybody can read the messages. 


To install you need:
Python 3.13 installed,
Python's httpd module installed,
An internet/Network connection
