# READ ME PLEASE
The Vox Mundi protocol is a PTP (Peer To Peer) networking protocol for unrestricted communication.

this protocol was first thought of by my father, now I have the tools & knowlege to make it come to life :)
It is a basic protocol for data/message transfer using my custom encoding so not just anybody can read the messages. 


To install the home network version you need:
Python 3.13 installed,
Python's sockets, os & time modules installed
and a Network connection.

To install the world nework version you will need:
A computer with a x86-64 CPU running either Linux or Windows
and an internet connection.
